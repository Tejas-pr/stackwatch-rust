# StackWatch (Rust)

StackWatch is a **Rust-based REST backend** for an all-in-one observability platform inspired by **Better Stack**.  
It is designed to power logging, uptime monitoring, and application performance tracking with a focus on **performance, safety, and scalability**.

## 📦 Status
🚧 This project is currently under **active development**.

## 🎯 Goal
To build a **production-ready observability backend** in Rust while learning and applying:
- High-performance REST APIs
- System monitoring and telemetry
- Logging pipelines and metrics collection
- Scalable backend architecture

## 🏗 Architecture

The backend follows a modular service-oriented design, enabling future expansion into distributed monitoring components.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Rust**
- **REST APIs**
- Async runtime (Tokio)
- Designed for containerized and cloud-native deployments
